1. A Light in the Moon
2. A LIGHT in the moon the only light is on Sunday.
3. What was the sensible decision. The sensible decision
4. was that notwithstanding many declarations and more music,
5. not even withstanding the choice and a torch and a
6. collection, notwithstanding the celebrating hat and a
7. vacation and even more noise than cutting, notwithstanding
8. Europe and Asia and being overbearing, not even
9. notwithstanding an elephant and a strict occasion, not
10. even withstanding more cultivation and some seasoning, not
11. even with drowning and with the ocean being encircling, not
12. even with more likeness and any cloud, not even with terrific
13. sacrifice of pedestrianism and a special resolution, not
14. even more likely to be pleasing. The care with which the rain
15. is wrong and the green is wrong and the white is wrong, the
16. care with which there is a chair and plenty of breathing. The
17. care with which there is incredible justice and likeness, all
18. this makes a magnificent asparagus, and also a fountain.
