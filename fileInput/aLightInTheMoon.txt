A Light in the Moon
A LIGHT in the moon the only light is on Sunday.
What was the sensible decision. The sensible decision
was that notwithstanding many declarations and more music,
not even withstanding the choice and a torch and a
collection, notwithstanding the celebrating hat and a
vacation and even more noise than cutting, notwithstanding
Europe and Asia and being overbearing, not even
notwithstanding an elephant and a strict occasion, not
even withstanding more cultivation and some seasoning, not
even with drowning and with the ocean being encircling, not
even with more likeness and any cloud, not even with terrific
sacrifice of pedestrianism and a special resolution, not
even more likely to be pleasing. The care with which the rain
is wrong and the green is wrong and the white is wrong, the
care with which there is a chair and plenty of breathing. The
care with which there is incredible justice and likeness, all
this makes a magnificent asparagus, and also a fountain.
-Gertrude Stein, 1914
